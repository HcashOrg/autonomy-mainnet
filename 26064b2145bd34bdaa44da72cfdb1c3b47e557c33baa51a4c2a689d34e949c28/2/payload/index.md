Improve HyperCash main net performance
To improve HyperCash main net performance, HyperCash’s (HC) development team has proposed an upgrade which aims to improve HC’s block speed and TPS. This proposal has been published on HC Autonomy and HC community members can vote for it.

**Proposal summary **

Improve HyperCash main net performance and optimise algorithm 

**Proposal background **

The HCASH HyperCash main net has been running stably since its launch. With the implement of HC Omni Protocol and other application protocols, HyperCash has gradually improved the performance of its main net and optimised its mining algorithms. It can be expected that the performance if the HC main net will improve significantly after this upgrade.

The proposed upgrade will also benefit the development of HCASH AI Lightning Protocol (HAIL Protocol), which was scheduled to begin and accomplish in this year as previously stated in the HCASH Yellow Paper and the HCASH roadmap. 

After a series of technical tests, HCASH development team has managed to optimise HC mining algorithms by increasing HC’s TPS and block speed. The code is ready to be released.

**Technical plan details**

* After this upgrade, HC’s TPS will increase by 200% up to 1,000, while block speed will be increased, reaching 60 seconds. 
* Optimise block reward reduction algorithm. Block rewards will continue to be reduced every 12,888 blocks, the reduction function however, will be adjusted from 999/1,000 + arithmetic progression parameter to 998/1,000 + arithmetic progression parameter.

**Vote for it**

* Proposal will be released on HC Autonomy for community to review (from now to 18:00, 8th April)

* The community can vote for the proposal (from 18:00, 8th April to 18:00, 16th April)

Note: the proposal can only be approved by meeting the following requirement:

1. votes that participate in proposal voting should be no less that 75% of the total amount of active votes
2. b.votes that approve the proposal should be no less than 75% of the votes that participate in this proposal voting
